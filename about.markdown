Throughout my career I've focused on finding innovative ways to make vast datasets accessible to biologists, first at the Sanger Institute and then playing a key role in pioneering the informatics of next-generation sequencing at Solexa, where I developed the first alignment program for "short read" DNA sequences. My subsequent work at Illumina encompassed a wide range of DNA sequencing applications, including collaborating with Genomics England on population-scale genotyping and applying machine learning to comparative genomics.

I have extensive experience in applying professional software engineering practices to develop tools in both C/C++ and scripting languages. I enjoy opportunities to collaborate and learn from scientists in other disciplines and to interact with the academic community. Many years of working in teams distributed across sites and time zones has enabled me to work very effectively in such a context.
