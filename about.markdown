Throughout my career, I've been dedicated to finding innovative ways to make vast datasets accessible to biologists. This journey began at the Sanger Institute and continued at Solexa, where I played a key role in pioneering the informatics of next-generation sequencing and developed the first [program](https://github.com/BEETL/ELAND) for aligning "short read" DNA sequences. My subsequent work at Illumina encompassed a wide range of DNA sequencing applications, including collaborating with Genomics England on population-scale genotyping and applying machine learning to comparative genomics.

I'm skilled in applying professional software engineering practices to tackle complex challenges in bioinformatics by developing tools in both C/C++ and scripting languages. I enjoy opportunities to collaborate and learn from scientists in other disciplines and to interact with the academic community. Many years of working across geographical locations and time zones has honed my ability to be effective in distributed teams.
