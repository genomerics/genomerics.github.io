Genomerics provides bioinformatics and software services to small and medium enterprises in the biotech space. We are based in Cambridge UK but we're happy to work remotely too.

Just starting out with next-generation sequencing, or wanting to scale up? We bring a broad and up-to-date knowledge of third-party tools and pipelines, from which we can tailor robust and maintainable solutions to your bioinformatics challenges. Or, for more specialized applications, our deep understanding of the data and our software and algorithmic expertise means we're equally at home building our own well-engineered software tools from both C/C++ and scripting languages.

Get in touch via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coxtonyj/) or schedule a call with [Calendly](https://calendly.com/anthony-j-cox/30min) to chat about how Genomerics can help your business achieve its goals.
